# Authentication Buttons Demo

This project provides a simple, self-contained HTML page showcasing two professionally designed and responsive authentication buttons: "Login" and "Sign Up". It's built with a modern UI/UX approach using pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with no external dependencies.

## Features

*   **Login & Sign Up Buttons:** Clearly labeled and styled buttons for user authentication actions.
*   **Modern & Professional Design:** Clean aesthetics with a tasteful color scheme and typography for a contemporary feel.
*   **Fully Responsive:** Designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across all device sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
*   **Semantic HTML5:** Utilizes appropriate HTML5 elements for better accessibility and structure.
*   **Self-Contained:** All CSS is embedded within `<style>` tags and JavaScript within `<script>` tags, making it a single-file solution.
*   **No External Dependencies:** No external stylesheets, scripts, or CDN links are used, making it lightweight and fast.
*   **Interactive:** Basic JavaScript alerts provide immediate feedback upon button clicks.
*   **Accessibility:** Includes basic accessibility considerations like `aria-labelledby` and `focus-visible` styles.
